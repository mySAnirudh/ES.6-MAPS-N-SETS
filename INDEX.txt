   ES6 introduces two new data structures: maps and sets. Let us learn about them in detail.
Maps


   >>Data structures :- A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so 
   that it can be used effectively.
   For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using
    the array data structure.



A map is an ordered collection of key-value pairs. Maps are similar to objects. However, 
there are some differences between maps and objects. These are listed below:
S. No Object Map
1 Keys cannot be Object type Keys can be any type
2 Keys are not ordered Keys are ordered
3 not iterable iterable
Syntax
The syntax for Map is given below:
 let map= new Map([iterable])
 let map= new Map()
Example
The following example creates a map using an iterable constructor:
<script>
 let andy ={ename:"Andrel"},
 varun = {ename:"Varun"},
 prijin={ename:"Prijin"}
 let empJobs = new Map([
 [andy,'Software Architect'],
 [varun,'Developer']]
 );
 console.log(empJobs)
</script>
The output of the above code is as shown below:
